## About the project! üé®

Mobile chating app built with <b>React Native, Apollo, GraphQL, GraphQL PubSub </b>.
Main goal was to try out doing mobile dev with RN. Turned out pretty fun!ü§ó

Things that were new for me: 
* React Native
* Expo
* GraphQL PubSub
* Didn't have much experiance with Apollo before 

## Main Screen

On the main screen there are 2 main things:
* List of user's available rooms
* Bottom Tab which gives info about logged in user + let's log out

When we join one of the room, and then leave we will still get <b>notification</b
about upcoming messages. It happens like that cuz even when we leave the room,
we're still subscribed to the last chat.
